# Weather Project

## outline:

report feature: allows you to print an image with weather and some symbols

plot feature: plots the temperature for either the year or a single month

maybe another one


### Future:
- Add API support to get weather data from somewhere and real time data from a certain city
- Add to the raspberry pi zero. Maybe add an RTOS component and make an embedded system
- Add a ML model to make better predictions on the task the user wants
