# Weather Project
This script gets weather data from the user's location. The script first uses the user's IP Address and [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) to get location coordinates and then uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get weather data.

## TO DO:
- add exceptions for common errors
	- config file not created
	- API key not available
	- any config file issues
- fix classes
- fix printing data issues
- edit images and add all data gained from API
