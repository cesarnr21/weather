# Weather Project

## outline:

- Add API support to get weather data from somewhere and real time data from a certain city
- Have two operation modes:
	- a default that just uses your IP or location information and pulls up weather data for your city
	- an option in which you can specify a particular city
- edit images and add all data gained from API
