# Weather Project
This script gets weather data from the user's location. The script first uses this [checkip](http://checkip.dyndns.org/) and [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) to get the user's IP Address and location coordinates, and then uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get weather data. Thank you to these entities for providing their services for free.
